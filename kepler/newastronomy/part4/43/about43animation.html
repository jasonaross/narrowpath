This <a href="43animation.swf">animation</a> is made with the true eccentricities of the vicarious hypothesis, and the eccentricity used by Kepler in chapter 43 for area-time.  Since the differences between the locations are small (around 8' max), the <em>differences</em> between the three different locations have been exaggerated.  This means that the bisected and the area-time locations have had their distance from the vicarious location multiplied by an exaggeration factor (25&times; in this animation).
