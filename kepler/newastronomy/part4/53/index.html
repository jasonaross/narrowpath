<p class="quote">&ldquo;Since we are establishing new hypotheses here, in that we are enquiring into the natural cause of the eccentric equations, it is appropriate that we should explore everything as carefully as possible, lest in neglecting the foundations we build upon them a building doomed to ruin. And so we will further our cause to explore this same thing (perfectly accurate distances of Mars from the sun) by many methods.&rdquo;</p>
<hr>

<p>In this chapter, Kepler is trying the second time, like in chapter 51, to determine the distances from sun-Mars, but this time he takes observations before and after the acronychal position.</p>

<p>This applied method is again, a real <i>Kunstgriff</i> (skill-grip).  The skill-grip will be constructed with the event of opposition, which is when the Sun, Earth and Mars lie on one line. These oppositions are phenomena resulting from the relationship between the two first inequalities from the motion of Earth to Mars. The first inequality arises from the difference between the Earth&rsquo;s path and Mars&rsquo; path. This is  why Earth stands behind Mars before it enters into the opposition, and after the opposition stands ahead of Mars, since the Earth has passed it.  Kepler takes two Earth positions before and after the opposition with Mars.  As a result you automatically get two Mars locations in different directions.  Since the Sun-Earth distance was already determined in chapter 30, he takes these two Earth positions and tries to ascertain the Sun-Mars distance.</p>

<p>The difficulty here is to obtain the angle (acronychal position) between the Mars locations and the Sun.  This is resolved, if the Sun-Earth distance is not quite correct (Kepler has for various reasons modified it), since then the angles between the two Earth locations and the Sun would change.</p>

<p>This would affect the acronychal position and the Sun-Mars distances.  Therefore, even the smallest change in angle, or data, or in the distances automatically affects every other important factor. All factors are attached to each other and this is what Kepler is using to precisely determine the distance from the sun to Mars.  Kepler&rsquo;s creativity is using the periodic events to surround the solution. In this hypothesis lies a inherent connection like in every good hypothesis.</p>

<p class="quote">&ldquo;So we must assume such distances as will make the angle of motion on the eccentric come out correctly.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="caption">This is what happens when you change the angle from Sun to Mars location (acronychal position) or the Sun-Earth distance.  It becomes clear that all factors are connected to each other and affect one another.</p>




<H3>Requirements</H3>
<p>Kepler noticed quickly, that the used data must have a special relationship to get the required results, namely the exact Sun-Mars distances.  The elongation of the Earth from the line through the Sun and the planet, at which any error in the distance of Mars from the sun would be most conspicuous.  A specific relationship between the Sun, Mars and Earth is demanded:</p>

<p class="quote">&ldquo;For, following that chapter, we shall define it as that angle at the Sun whose sine has to the radius about the same ratio as the excess of Mars&rsquo; distance from the sun over the sine of the complement of the angle has to the distance itself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The arrangement must have the required geometrical proportions, which are as accurate as the distances.  The next step is to find data with these proportions.</p>





<H3>Determining the Distances</H3>

<p class="quote">&ldquo;
And now, having found the termini at which any error that may arise will be most evident, owing to an incorrect distance of Mars from the Sun, it is easy for us to choose suitable observations, since many are available.
&rdquo;</p>

<center><img src="chart-small.jpg"></center>
<p class="caption">These are the data with the aforementioned proportion.  We give the calculuations for Jan 26 as an example.</p>

<p>Kepler calculated the distance from the sun to Mars, with the selected data, for the opposition years of 1582 in Cancer, 1585 in Leo, 1587 in Virgo, 1589 in Scorpio, 1591 in Sagittarius, 1593 in Pisces, and 1595 in Taurus.  The calculation was full of problems: 
each change requires him to recalculate the angle and compare it with the other factors, until all the parameters come together to form a whole.</p>

<p>As an example, we will determine the Sun-Mars distance for Jan 26, 1583.</p>

These, then, are the distances that will result from an investigation using the method of this chapter and the observations proposed.
&rdquo;</p>

<center><img src="chart-large.jpg"></center>

<H3>Afterthought</H3>
<p>Those distances have to be correctly found, to determine later, in chapter 54, the relationship of the ratio of the orbs, for example the eccentricity of Mars. This serves with the comparison of the results from chapter 42, 51 and 53.</p>
<p>The relationship of the ratio of the orbs defined the route or the path of the orbits. If, using the distances, we calculated the relationship accurately, we can then use it (in chapter 55) to disprove the hypothesis of chapter 45.  So with that, an absolutely new hypothesis about the shape of Mars orbit can be developed.</p>
