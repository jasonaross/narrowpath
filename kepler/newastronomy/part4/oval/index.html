<H3>Advice to readers on chapters 46-50</H3>
<p><strong>Don't read these chapters!</strong>  Or, at least don't linger on them.  They are incredibly difficult, and can take as much time to work through as the entire remainder of Part <a href="../index.html">IV</a>.

<p>It is not without reason that Kepler writes in chapter 45 that &ldquo;But then what they say in the proverb, &lsquo;a hasty dog bears blind pups&rsquo;, happened to me.&rdquo;  The chapters in which Kepler implements his oval hypothesis are <em>very</em> difficult, and, taken together, can take almost as much mental energy as the remainder of Part <a href="../index.html">IV</a>.  For this reason, it is <em>not</em> advisable to work thoroughly through all the chapters in this section the first time through the book, or, if you do, remember what happens in the preceding four chapters 41-44.  Kepler has proven that Mars cannot move in a circle, and that the orbit must be brought in at the sides.</p>
<p>Kepler's suggestion of the uniform epicycle of Chapter 45 may strike a modern reader as being regressive
