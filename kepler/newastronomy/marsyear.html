<H1>How long is a Mars year?</H1>
We know how long a year is for our Earth, right?  It's the time for the seasons to return, or the time to again have the spring equinox.  These two times aren't actually exactly the same due to the precession of the equinoxes, but let's not worry about that for now.  Kepler uses the length of a Mars year when calculating mean longitudes in Part II, and for keeping Mars in the same spot in Part III.  But how do we know how long a year is for Mars?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We could look for when Mars is again in the same constellation, to correspond to us on the Earth seeing the sun behind almost the same constellation in a year.  But, the amount of time for Mars to return to the same sign can vary wildly:<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This method does not work.  We do have something that recurs almost evenly for Mars, however: oppositions.  Although they are not evenly spaced in time (as we measure time in days here on earth by our rotation), we find an average for the time between oppositions to be 780 days.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So if Mars and Earth are side-by-side every 780 days, let's figure out how long it takes for Mars to go around exactly once.  We know that in 780 days, the Earth has revolved around the sun twice in 730 days, with 50 days left over.  In those 50 days, the earth goes around the sun 50/365 of an orbit.  Since Mars and Earth are neck-and-neck in 780 days, Mars must have been lapped in its race with the Earth.  They are at the same place on the track (50/365 along it), so Mars must have run 1 (50/365) laps.

Now, with a simple division:

<TR><TD> <CENTER>780</CENTER> <TD>        </TR>
<TR><TD>        <HR>          <TD> = 686, </TR>
<TR><TD>&nbsp;1 (50/365)&nbsp;<TD>        </TR>
</TABLE></CENTER>
we find that one Mars year is 686 days.
