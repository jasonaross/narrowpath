<p>As the international LaRouche Youth Movement (LYM) works through Kepler's <i>Astronomia Nova</i> -- the begining of modern science along the narrow track of revolutionary development of the relationship of humanity to the universe -- this page is constantly being updated.&nbsp;  Here is a list of &ldquo;revisions&rdquo; since the official launch of the site in September, 2006.</p>

	<DT>Mar 8, 2008</DT>
<DD>A new page for chapter <a href="part5/68/index.html">68</a> has been created!</DD>
	<DT>Jan 12, 2008</DT>
<DD>&bull; A <a href="part2/16/k16-work.swf">calculator</a> has been added to the chapter <a href="part2/16/index.html#calculator">16</a> page, letting you go through the calculations exactly as Kepler did in determining the vicarious hypothesis.</DD>
<DD>&bull; Chapter <a href="part5/62/index.html">62</a> has a page beautifully demonstrating the minor premise of the argument.</DD>
	<DT>Jan 11, 2008</DT>
<DD>A link has been made for chapter <a href="part5/61/index.html">61</a>.</DD>
	<DT>Dec 1, 2007</DT>
<DD>Brief pages have been made for more chapters in <a href="part5/index.html">Part V</a></DD>
	<DT>October 16, 2007</DT>
<DD>Chapters <a href="part4/42/index.html">42</a> and <a href="part4/44/index.html">44</a> have been created.</DD>
	<DT>October 14, 2007</DT>
<DD>Chapter <a href="part4/57/index.html">57</a> has been significantly expanded, and no longer crashes your web browser when you look at it!</DD>
    <DT>September 22, 2007</DT>
<DD>Chapters <a href="part4/50/index.html">50</a> and <a href="part4/54/index.html">54</a> have been created (although not completed), and chapters <a href="part4/51/index.html">51</a>, <a href="part4/52/index.html">52</a>, and <a href="part4/56/index.html">56</a> have been updated.  Chapter 51 had missing distances at the middle longitudes (154,400 and 154,278) which have now been added, and chapter 56 had its animated gif converted to a Flash file.</DD>

	<DT>September 11, 2007</DT>
<DD><a href="part4/48/index.html">Chapter 48</a> has been created.</DD>	
	<DT>September 9, 2007</DT>
<DD><a href="part4/49/index.html">Chapter 49</a> has been created.</DD>	
	<DT>September 2, 2007</DT>
<DD><a href="part4/47/index.html">Chapter 47</a> has been created.</DD>
	<DT>August 30, 2007</DT>
<DD>A thorough page for <a href="part4/46/index.html">chapter 46</a> has been created, with an animation of the <a href="part4/46/chapter46-3.swf">oval path</a>, which, you will notice, does not look the same as the animation in chapter <a href="part4/45/index.html">45</a>.</DD>
	<DT>August 21, 2007</DT>
<DD>Two additions have been made recently.  The page for <a href="part4/43/index.html">chapter 43</a> has been updated, and an <a href="part4/43/43animation.swf">animation</a> has been made to demonstrate the difference between the vicarious hypothesis, the bisected version of that hypothesis, and the area-time hypothesis.</DD>
<DD>Also, an animation that allows you to see how an equant would have to behave in a universe governed by gravitation, is available <a href="na-lab/aboutMovingEquant.html">here</a>.</DD>

<img align=left src="pictures/whatsnew-2-small.jpg">
	
	<DT>July 5, 2007</DT>
<DD>The <a href="na-lab/index.html">equant model</a> has been updated to display the angles, allowing you to check Kepler's results in chapters 18 and 19.</DD>
    <DT>June 15, 2007</DT>
<DD>A new animation has been added to the <a href="na-lab/index.html">lab</a>, an interactive <a href="na-lab/equant.html">equant model</a>.</DD>
<DD>The vicarious hypothesis <a href="part2/VicariousHypothesis.swf">interactive animation</a> has been updated.  Open it and press <b><tt>i</tt></b> to see the new options.  Why must Kepler use four observation, when Ptolemy used only three?</DD>
	<DT>June 1, 2007</DT>
<DD>The <a href="java.html">Computer Help</a> has been updated, and a <a href="firsttime.html">guide</a> for new visitors has been added.</DD>
	<DT>May 22, 2007</DT>
<DD>The vicarious hypothesis <a href="part2/VicariousHypothesis.swf">animation</a> has been corrected to actually change angles FAH and FCH as Kepler does.</DD>
	<DT>May 19, 2007</DT>
<DD><a href="part1/copernicus.html">Chapter 4</a> has been updated.  There is still a link to the <a href="part1/copernicus-old.html">old version</a>.</DD>

<img align=right src="pictures/j-thinking-small.jpg">

	<DT>May 17, 2007</DT>
<DD><a href="part2/VicariousHypothesis.swf">Flash Animation</a> for the vicarious hypothesis of <a href="part2/16/index.html">chapter 16</a>.</DD>
	<DT>May 14, 2007</DT>
<DD><a href="part1/MegaEquivalence.swf">Equivalence of Hypotheses</a> added (in Flash).  It uses the apparent sun.  Mean sun is in the works.</DD>
	<DT>May 9, 2007</DT>
<DD><a href="part4/56/index.html">Chapter 56</a> has been corrected!  The old page was in <a href="part4/56/errors.html">error</a>.</DD>
<DD><a href="part4/58/index.html">Chapter 58</a>, which made reference to 56, has also been <a href="part4/58/errors.html">corrected</a>.</DD>
	<DT>April 20, 2007</DT>
<DD><a href="part4/51/index.html">Chapter 51</a> has one <a href="part4/51/spica.html">small animation</a> added to it.</DD>
    <DT>February 26, 2007</DT>
<DD><a href="part4/41/index.html">Chapter 41</a> is done now.</DD>
	<DT>February 4, 2007</DT>
<DD><a href="part3/37/index.html">Chapter 37</a> has been updated, with the first Flash animation for this site.</DD>
<DD><a href="part4/41/index.html">Chapter 41</a> has been created.</DD>
	<DT>January 19, 2007</DT>
<DD>Links for <a href="part3/37/index.html">Chapter 37</a> (including Disney teacups!) and <a href="part3/38/index.html">Chapter 38</a> are now active.</DD>
	<DT>January 5, 2007</DT>
<DD>There now exists yet another almost-elliptical animation, this time in <a href="part3/30/index.html">Chapter 30</a>, where Kepler develops his table of Sun-Earth distances.</DD>
	<DT>December 17, 2006</DT>
<DD>Based on an idea from Michelle, <a href="part2/21/index.html">Chapter 21</a> now has its own page with animations.  Now the real false hypothesis is available, rather than only an algebraic attempt to make a catenary.</DD>
	<DT>December 7, 2006</DT>
<DD><a href="part2/9/index.html">Chapter 9</a> is now complete, with more animations, and with corrections.</DD>
