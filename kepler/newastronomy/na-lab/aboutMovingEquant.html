<p align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	In chapter 32 of the New Astronomy, Kepler hypothesizes the form of action of a physical principle.  The footprints of this physical principle are the apparent existence of an equant and a bisected eccentricity in the motions of all of the planets.  The true principle of universal gravitation operates in such a way as to cause planets to spend less time moving the same distance, in proportion to how close they are to the sun.  In <a href"../part3/40/index.html">chapter 40</a>, Kepler first proposes the notion of <a href="../part3/areatime/index.html">equal area-equal time</a> to measure the sum of the infinite number of times the planet took to traverse infinitesimal arcs.  He tests it in <a href="../part4/43/index.html">chapter 43</a>, but it does not work to accurately give the position of Mars when its orbit is assumed to be circular.</p>
<p align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	But what if we were to combine the two ideas?  What if we made a model that included both an equant, <em>and</em> the principle of gravitation?  What would necessarily have to happen to the equant, were it to sweep equal angles in equal times?  Experiment with this animation to find out:</p>

	As in a number of other animations, you can use <tt><b>a</b></tt> and <tt><b>z</b></tt> to change the speed and the <tt><b>spacebar</b></tt> to pause.  You can also use <tt><b>s</b></tt> and <tt><b>x</b></tt> to change the eccentricity.</p>
