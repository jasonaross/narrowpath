Here, the inclination is 30&deg;.  If you spin the sphere upside-down, this animation will appear similar to the earlier ones with the dark background.

	The Earth's ecliptic is BLUE and Mars's eccentric is RED.  Mars itself is RED, while its "ecliptic position" is BLUE.  The position on Earth's ecliptic that a Martian would consider to have the same eccentric position as Mars is in GREEN.  That is, a perpendicular from Mars to the ecliptic hits at the blue point, while a line extended perpendicularly from Mars's orbit will hit the ecliptic at the green point.  Kepler writes that, given the true inclination of 1&deg;50', the difference between the blue and green points is never even as large as a minute.
