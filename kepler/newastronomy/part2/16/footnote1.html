<H1>On distances</H1>

<H2>Question:</H2>
The distances Tycho gives are:
<UL>
<LI>BA = 97,500
<LI>AC = 101,400
</UL>
but Kepler says that "in the correction which is to follow, BA turns out a little longer and AC a little shorter; they are not equal, however."  So the correct lengths are closer to each other than Tycho says, meaning that the eccentricity of the Earth-Sun orbit is smaller than Tycho indicates.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	Can you think of what would cause Tycho to make this error?  Look again at the <a href="aside.html">aside</a> if you want a hint.
