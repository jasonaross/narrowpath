What causes the moon to increase its rate of motion at conjunction and opposition?
<blockquote><i>&ldquo;Now let CLOF be the orb of the moon, O the moon at <u>o</u>pposition, C at <u>c</u>onjunction, L, F at quadratures, and let it move in the direction OFCL.&nbsp; The question is, by what cause is the moon made to move more swiftly about T at C,O than at F,L, since we have just now mentally removed the eccentricity and epicycles.&rdquo;</i> (p.401)</blockquote></td>

<blockquote><i>Here, I know, the reader will expect me to say that it is swifter at O because at that place its motion is in the same direction as the motion of all the planets.</i> (p.401)</blockquote>
	
<p>This hypothesis would indeed make the moon move faster at O (when farthest from the sun), but causes it to move more slowly at C (closest to the sun), which goes against Brahe's observations.&nbsp; Watching the end of the moon's trail can help you picture the changing speed.&nbsp; Also, although this causes the moon to move more quickly <i>through space</i> at O, it does <i>not</i> imply that it would appear to move any faster <i>from the earth</i>.</p>

<p>If this image can help you, you could consider the moon as a teacup from the amusement park ride.&nbsp; Each set of four teacups spins at a constant speed, and the whole platter of teacup-sets moves as well, creating a changing speed of each individual teacup.&nbsp; But standing at the center of a set of four teacups, while watching one, you see only the uniform spin.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TrjyxlxIrQ">Teacup video</a>  (These teacup sets move opposite to the platter as a whole, so, unlike the moon, they go quickest towards the center at C and slowest at the outside at O.)</p>
