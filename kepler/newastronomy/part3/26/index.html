<center><h1>Chapter 26</h1></center>

<p>This is by no means a complete conception of chapter 26, but rather a simple animation to look at the effect of changing the length of &alpha;&eta; -- the distance of the Earth from the Sun.  In the following animation, the <tt><b>s</b></tt> key increases, and the <tt><b>x</b></tt> key decreases, this distance.  Point &eta; is the lower right earth position.  By changing its distance only slightly (which entails a very small change in the geocentric position of Mars), the line of apsides and eccentricity change rather dramatically.  The other two positions of the Earth, &zeta; and &delta;, stay at the same place.  Since three points make a circle, changing the position of &eta; changes the size and center of the circle.</p>
<p>Kepler suspects the length of &alpha;&eta; that he determined to be in error.  When he uses all three points to make a circle, he gets a line of apsides that is almost 10&deg; away from where he expected it to be.  By making a small change to &alpha;&eta;, the apsides come to be more in line with what he expected, and the eccentricity becomes close to the value of 1800 for a bisected eccentricity.  Since planetary position &eta; is so close to the line from Mars to the sun, a small change in the geocentric observed position of Mars has a proportionally large impact on the distance.</p>
