    It is true that in this way (that is, in associating the distance &alpha;&zeta; of the angle &delta;&alpha;&zeta; with an angle which is as much smaller than &delta;&alpha;&zeta;, as &delta;&alpha;&zeta; is smaller than &delta;&beta;&zeta;) a path is attached to the circuit of the earth (or sun) about &alpha; which is oval rather than exactly circular.

<p>When we follow Kepler's instructions, we will cause the planet to move along an oval (non-elliptical) path.</p>
<UL>
<LI>First, Kepler says that we will associated "the distance &alpha;&zeta;" with a new angle.&nbsp; This length &alpha;&zeta; is just the distance from the sun to the position of the planet if it moved in a circle.
<LI>Now, the planet will not be this distance from the sun at angle &delta;&alpha;&zeta;,but rather at "an angle which is as much smaller than &delta;&alpha;&zeta; as &delta;&alpha;&zeta; is smaller than &delta;&beta;&zeta;.&nbsp; So:
	<center>&delta;&alpha;&zeta; - new angle = &delta;&beta;&zeta; - &delta;&alpha;&zeta;.</center>
<LI>To construct this angle from &alpha;, we will recreate the angle &delta;&beta;&zeta; at &alpha;, by drawing a new line from &alpha; parallel to &beta;&zeta;.
<LI>Now, simply make a new line from &alpha;, by duplicating the difference of &delta;&beta;&zeta; to &delta;&alpha;&zeta;.&nbsp; Place the <font color=blue>planet</font> along this line, at distance &alpha;&zeta; from the sun, and you have the <font color=green>orbit</font> Kepler proposes:
</UL>

To review, three lines come out of the sun at &alpha;:
<UL>
<LI>One, with an angle at &alpha; equal to angle &delta;&beta;&zeta; is not connected to anything
<LI>&delta;&alpha;&zeta; is connected to the <font color=red>red</font> point on the circle
<LI>the third line is connected to the <font color=blue>blue</font> location of the planet on the oval path.
</UL>
The differences between these angles are the same.&nbsp; Further, the length from the sun to the red point is the same as the length from the sun to the blue point.
