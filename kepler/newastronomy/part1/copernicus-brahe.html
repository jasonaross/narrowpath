<hr>
<H3>Copernicus</H3>
Copernicus has the earth (blue) and Mars (red) go about the sun (yellow).

<br><hr>
<H3>Brahe</H3>
Brahe has the sun (yellow) go around the earth (blue) , and has Mars (red) go around the sun.
<ol>
<li>Watch the yellow sun.  It moves uniformly</li>
<li>Watch the bright green line connecting the sun with Mars.  It moves uniformly around the sun.</li>
</ol>

<H2>Combination</H2>
<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>
If we take each of these animations, and then "zoom out," we can see where on the infinitely-far-away zodiac the lines of sight from the earth to Mars and the sun appear.  As Kepler proves in his <i>New Astronomy</i>, the two are identical.  Note that the retrograde motion of Mars always occurs when it is at opposition to the sun.

<H3>To add</H3>
Both of these models have Mars moving on an epicycle, but this is done in the same way, so it does not alter the equivalence.
