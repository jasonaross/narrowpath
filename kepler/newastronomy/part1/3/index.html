<p>An animation of page 131: the equivalence of a concentric-with-epicycle (left) with an eccentric (right), and the difference encountered with the use of the apparent instead of the mean sun:</p>
<p>On the left, the center point is either the mean or the apparent sun.&nbsp; If it be the mean sun, then the planet would be said to be the blue planet, positioned on a certain epicycle.&nbsp; Were the center point the apparent sun, then the planet would follow the red course on a different epicycle.</p>
<center><IMG SRC="chapter3.gif"></center>
<p>On the right, rather than offsetting the planet, we instead use two different observers -- the blue mean sun and the red apparent sun -- with the planet moving on an eccentric.&nbsp; If a planet actually moved in this way, uniformly and on a circle, both observers would develop equivalent conclusions respecting its motion, that is, they could both discover where the center of the circle of motion is, as well as its speed.</p>
