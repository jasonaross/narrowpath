<H1>Chapter 6: Physical Heliocentrism:<br>
<small>Mean vs Apparent opposition -- second inequality</small></H1>

<blockquote><hr>
<i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;A door is therefore open to us for deciding by means of the observations what I had deduced <u>a priori</u> by consideration of moving causes: that the planet's line of apsides, which is the only line bisecting the planet's path into two semicircles equal both in size and in vigor, -- this line, I say, passes right through the center of the solar body and not (as the theorists have it) through some other point.&rdquo;</i> (p.167)

<p>Kepler's discovery of universal gravitation places the sun at the center of the world, not geometrically, but <i>physically</i>.

<!-- proves that the sun is the center of the world, not just geometrically, but <i>physically</i>.-->

Copernicus's use of the <i>mean</i> sun as the center ("putting his trust in Ptolemy") is geocentric: the mean sun is the center of the earth's orbit.&nbsp; This saves the appearances and geometrical compatibility with Ptolemy, but does not reflect thought as to <i>cause</i>.&nbsp; See page 160 for the physical absurdity of a point "empty, and propped up by nothing but imagination alone" being the cause of the speed of the planets.&nbsp; In this chapter, Kepler demonstrates that this question is not one of preference among a pantheon of equivalent geometric systems (as is the case with Ptolemy, Copernicus, and Brahe), but of substantial change: he proves the existence of crucial physical experiments to demonstrate conclusively that he is right.</p>

<p>Previously, in chapter 5, Kepler examined the effect on the first inequality, of the necessary change in hypothesis resulting from the shift from use of mean to apparent oppositions.&nbsp; Now, he takes up the effect this has on the hypothesis of the second (solar) inequality.</p>

<!--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ptolemy accounted for this second inequality by having the planet move on an epicycle whose center is the location of the first inequality.&nbsp; "Thus Ptolemy made his opinions correpsond to the data and to geometry, and has failed to sustain our admiration."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Copernicus believes that "this second inequality does not belong to the planet's own motion, but only appears to do so, and is really a by-product of the earth's annual motion around the motionless sun."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brahe transposes Ptolemy -- he causes the planets to move around the sun, substituting eccentrics on a single epicycle [of the sun] for Ptolemy's epicycles on eccentrics.<br>
-->


<p>Here you have the Copernican system, where &kappa; is the true body of the sun, &beta; the center of the earth's orbit (the mean sun), &delta; Mars's equant, and &lambda; the center of Mars's mean eccentric.&nbsp; At mean opposition, when the body of the earth lies on the line between &beta; and the planet (as, for example, at &upsilon; with Mars at &omega;), then "the planet has been supposed to be divested of the second inequality."  Using measurements of <font color="7F006A">mean</font> opposition, Copernicus created his hypothesized planetary path (purple).</p>
<p>It is clear that using apparent oppositions (with the true sun at &kappa; instead of the mean sun at &beta;) will give different results.&nbsp; See <a href="../5/index.html">Chapter 5</a>.&nbsp; The transformed hypothesis maintains the equant at &delta; but moves the line of apsides, changing the location of slowest movement from <font color="7F006A">&chi;</font> to <font color="EC2124">&eta;</font>, and the center of Mars's eccentric from <font color="7F006A">&lambda;</font> to <font color="EC2124">&mu;</font>.&nbsp; This new hypothesis, based on <font color="EC2124">apparent</font> oppositions, is red.</p>
<p>Now, in chapter 5 it was shown that from this change in hypothesis, "all the appearances at &beta; are left almost completely undisturbed."  But what about the second inequality?  How will the earth's view of the planet change?</p>
<p class="quote">&ldquo;It is required to find the point on the earth's orb from which the lines of vision passing through <font color="04803e">&epsilon;</font> and through <font color="04803e">&rho;</font> are at their greatest distance from one another and form the greatest angle of vision, and at which the error would be greatest if the planet were placed at <font color="04803e">&rho;</font> when it should have been placed at <font color="04803e">&epsilon;</font>.&rdquo; (p.163)</p>

<p>Kepler puts Mars at <font color="04803e">&rho;</font> for the Copernican mean hypothesis, and at <font color="04803e">&epsilon;</font> for Kepler's apparent hypothesis, while the earth is at <font color="04803e">&nu;</font>.&nbsp; The maximum difference in observed position of the planet, angle <font color="04803e">&rho;&nu;&epsilon;</font>, is found to be 1&deg;3'32", a substantial difference!</p>

<br clear=all>
<H3>Using this difference</H3>
<p>A new hypothesis resulting from the use of apparent oppositions engenders a significant, and observable change of appearances.&nbsp; This observable difference indicates the possibility of a crucial experiment to prove the necessity of using the apparent sun.&nbsp; Unlike the differences between the three planetary hypotheses of Ptolemy, Copernicus, and Brahe, this is a knowable question.&nbsp; This seemingly tiny change from mean to apparent sun, a difference of "only four semidiameters (diameters, according to the authorities) of the solar body" causes a larger <i>physical</i> effect, than the seemingly immense geometric shifts between Ptolemy, Copernicus and Brahe!  Of them, Kepler writes:</p>

Not so for the use of mean (fake!) versus apparent (true) observations.
