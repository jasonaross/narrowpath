<p>Kepler says that we need to draw the circle through &epsilon; and &rho; that is tangent to the circle of the earth's orbit.  The point of tangency is &nu;.  But why choose &nu; this way?  This animation shows all the different places &nu; could have been, and the resulting locations of &psi;, the center of the circle.  Now, from Euclid, the angle subtending the arc &epsilon;&rho; is twice as large at the center &psi; as at any location on the circumference on the circle &nu;.  Since the distance &epsilon;&rho; is always the same, it will appear as a bigger angle &epsilon;&psi;&rho; when &psi; is as close as possible.  As you can see, the smallest circle is the one that touches the earth's orbit only once -- the tangent.  At that location, the line connecting circle centers &beta; and &psi; goes directly through &nu;.  Thus, we achieve the largest angle of difference &epsilon;&nu;&rho; at this tangent point.</p>
